These steps assume you have already cloned the `pagebuilder-examples` repo to the root of your Magento instance, as described in [Installing the example modules](../../README.md):

1. Navigate to to the `app/code/` directory and create a symlink using the following command:

    ```bash
    ln -s ../../pagebuilder-examples/FAQ
    ```

1. From the Magento root directory, run the `setup:upgrade` command to install and enable the module:

   ```bash
   bin/magento setup:upgrade
   ```

1. Drag and drop an FAQ content type to the stage and start entering content.
